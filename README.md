# Hornet

* https://github.com/nectify/hornet

## Description

Hornet is a realtime engine that let you enhance your web application by connecting users together. Hornet is a publish/suscribe system extremely easy to use, secure and scalable. Well, Hornet will integrates very well your own existing application, no matter what language or framework you're using.

Hornet is powered by NodeJs, Socket.io and is backed by Redis.

### Hornet philosophy: core engine and connectors

Hornet is intented to act as a hub for your existing web application, offering the possibility to keep a pool of connected users and broadcasting messages to them in realtime. That's where NodeJS is goot at.

The connector is a small library that your existing application will use to connect your clients to Hornet and to broadcast message to them. When a client access a page with realtime features on it, your web application will generates a connection token to let the client subscribe to a hornet channel. 

When you want to broadcast a message to a specific channel, you'll also use the hornet connector to publish it. Using Redis publish/subscribe mechanism, Hornet core engines will be notified by this new message and transfer it to subscribed clients.

Hornet messages should always be JSON valid objects, containing at least the "type" attribute.

### Features

* Realtime publishing to clients from your existing web application
* Secure subscription to channels, using temporary, non-consecutive 9-chars base 62 numbers.
* Specified architecture for connectors, and connectors available in multiples languages: Java and Ruby at the moment
* Lots of supported transports and browsers thanks to [Socket.io](http://socket.io/)
* Multichannel supports, you can now connect to multiple channel


## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)


## Installation

	npm install hornet -g

## Starting a hornet instance

First, be sure that redis server is already launched

	redis-server

Then launch hornet:
  
	hornet

How to scale? Just launch more hornet instances and load balance them though a TCP load balancer.

## Client side JavaScript API    

### Required libs

Include theses two libraries :

	<script src="http://host:port/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
	<script src="http://host:port/hornet/hornet.js"></script>

Note that Hornet is running on port 8187 by default. If you want to expose Hornet on port 80 on your domain, use a TCP load balancer, like HAProxy


### Instantiate the connection

Token should be generated for one or multiple channels using a connector. See the dedicated section below.

	// javascript
	var hornet = new Hornet({ uri: 'uri', channels: ['channel1', 'channel2'], token: 'token' });
	hornet.connect();

You can always use the old synthax but it's deprecated now :

	// javascript
	var hornet = new Hornet(uri, channel, token);
	hornet.connect();

Note: this synthax doesn't support multichannel.

Example :

	// javascript
	var hornet = new Hornet({ uri: 'http://localhost:8187', channels: ['news', 'privateMessages'], token: 'VhjHU89Jhk' });
	hornet.connect();    


## Messages handling

Each time a new message is coming, an event is raised. Simply handle them like the following:

	// javascript
	hornet.on("channel","message_type", function ( messageData ) {
		// your own code here
	});

Note that you can handle the same type on multiple channels like the following:

	// javascript
	hornet.on(["channel", "channel2"], "message_type", function ( messageData ) {
		// your own code here
	});

### Excluding clients from a message broadcast

If message have the except attribute setted, with a token as value, then the client will not be notified from the message.

Example:

	Client with token "a3RErg5Z" has subscribed to channel "cookie"
	Client with token "2dlk5ELM" has subscribed to channel "cookie"
	Client with token "EKR39Ehg" has subscribed to channel "cookie"	
	Client with token "a3RErg5Z" sends "{ type: "foo", except: "a3RErg5Z", text: "dummy" }"
	Hornet is notified of the new message, broadcasts it to clients with tokens : "2dlk5ELM" and "EKR39Ehg"

## Hornet channel
This channel is only used for handling intern events like disconnect or error.

### Handling error 

Hornet can throw some event through the socket, like an invalid token. Use the following to handle that case :

	//javascript
	hornet.on("hornet", "error", function (reply) {
		// Something went wrong
	};

	//javascript
	//Exemple of a reply :
	{ 
	  type: "error",
	  channel: "hornet",
	  error: "INVALID_TOKEN", 
	  errorMsg : "Invalid token used, please get a new token" 
	};

### Reconnect when loosing the connection

Socket.io has an built-in system for reconnection, but Hornet has it own too. It allow you to ask for a new token to initialize a new connection. You just have to define the "disconnect" event with this :

	//javascript
	hornet.on("hornet", disconnect", function ( ) {
		//Ajax calling to get a new token ?
	};

After that, the client will try to open a new connection to Hornet with the new token. Note that, it let some time between two attempts and it increase over the time to a maximum of 30 seconds.

## Hornet connectors 

### Specifications

Each connector should expose the following described methods, adapted to implementation language or framework

#### constructor

	initializer of the connector. Should be parametrized with Redis connection settings.

#### create access token

	param string : channel : name of the channel associated to the access token
	return string : the access token

#### disconnect tokens

	param string list : tokens : list of tokens to permanently disconnect from any hornet instance

#### publish

	param string : channel : name of the channel to publish
	param string : type : type of the message that is going to be published
	param string : message : JSON object containing all the message data to be broadcasted
	param string list : options : pair of key/value of options that will be merged with @message.
	return number : the result of the redis.publish event

#### redis

	return redis client instance : the redis client instance used by the connector

#### TTL

	property : the value of time to live for access token. Should be 120 seconds as default ( 2 minuts ) 

### List of existing connectors

Each language who has an existing Redis client library should be able to produce an Hornet connector. At the moment, the following are existing:

* Java : https://github.com/nectify/hornet-connector-java
* Ruby : https://github.com/nectify/hornet-connector-ruby
